description: "Keeping wallets funded is critical for continuous product use. Credyt gives you two complementary ways to support top-ups - both powered by Stripe Checkout.
If your product includes alternative payment flows that you want to keep, be sure to read about Adjustments"

## Option 1: Billing Portal

The simplest way for your customers to add funds is through the hosted Billing Portal.

- Customers initiate top-ups directly in the portal.
- The only integration step is generating a session link and redirecting the customer.
- No signup is required on the customer side.
- As a platform, you do not control the flow and have no visibility into the process.

### More than just top-ups

The Billing Portal is also a self-service billing centre for your customers:

- Top-up manually whenever they want
- Auto Top-up - balance refills automatically once it falls below a threshold (continuous usage, no service interruptions, more revenue)
- Real-time balance visibility
- Product usage breakdowns
- Spend per product
- Top-up history

This makes the Billing Portal valuable even if you also implement the Top-up API. It saves you from building billing transparency and top-up management into your own platform.

### Create a Billing Portal Session

```bash
curl -X POST <https://api.dev.credyt.ai/billing-portal/sessions> \\
  -H "X-CREDYT-KEY: sk_test_123" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "customer_id": "cust_473cr1y0ghbyc3m1yfbwvn3nxx",
    "return_url": "<https://yourapp.com/account>",
    "failure_url": "<https://yourapp.com/callbacks/credyt-failure>"
  }'
```

➡️ Response:

```
{
  "redirect_url": "<https://billing.credyt.ai/customer-portal/sign-in?token=>...",
  "expires_at": "2025-09-16T13:00:00Z"
}
```

Redirect the customer to `redirect_url`. All top-ups and account views happen inside the portal. If you are using the Billing Portal, you may also need to configure callback URLs to handle session expiry or refresh.

⚠️ Note: For test integrations, all payments are processed through a shared test Stripe account to avoid onboarding delays. Later, we can set up your own Stripe test account to test branding and operations.
