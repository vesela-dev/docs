## Get started in three steps

You’ll need an **API key** (X-CREDYT-KEY) from your Credyt account.

### Step 1: Create a customer

To start billing, you first register the customer with Credyt.

We keep it minimal (just a name required), but it’s best to include an external reference for your own records.

```
curl -X POST <https://api.dev.credyt.ai/customers> \\
  -H "X-CREDYT-KEY: sk_test_123" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "name": "Acme AI",
    "external_id": "ext_acme_001"
  }'
```

➡️ Response:

```
{ "id": "cust_473cr1y0ghbyc3m1yfbwvn3nxx" }
```

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="(Optional) Simulate usage">
    Preview how usage would be priced before touching balances.

    Great for validating your product setup or experimenting with pricing. No balance changes here, just a **preview** of what Credyt would charge.

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://api.dev.credyt.ai/catalog/products/prd_test/latest/simulate-usage \
    -H "X-CREDYT-KEY: sk_test_123" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "101ee10e-3f95-4235-9f3e-976b0b01f3c4",
        "customer_id": "cust_473cr1y0ghbyc3m1yfbwvn3nxx",
        "event_type": "message_completed",
        "occurred_at": "2025-09-16T12:00:00Z",
        "data": {
          "model": "gpt-4-1",
          "input_tokens": 1200,
          "output_tokens": 800
        }
      }
    ]
    }'
    ```

    ➡️ Response:

    ```json
    {
      "fees": [
        { "price_name": "GPT 4.1 Input Tokens", "amount": 0.003529, "currency": "USD" }
      ]
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Top Up the Wallet

Give your test customer some credits without going through a full payment flow.

This endpoint also handles balance changes outside of Credyt (e.g. external PSP payments, refunds, or promotional credits).

```
curl -X POST <https://api.dev.credyt.ai/customers/cust_473cr1y0ghbyc3m1yfbwvn3nxx/wallet/adjustments> \\
  -H "X-CREDYT-KEY: sk_test_123" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "transaction_id": "016bb728-bb69-4c9a-b2c9-29a4a6cf332d",
    "asset": "USD",
    "amount": 50,
    "reason": "external_topup"
  }'
```

---

### Step 3: Send Real Usage

Submit actual usage events (e.g. API calls, tokens processed). Billable events will be deducted from the wallet

Each event has a unique ID for idempotency, and billing is applied in real time.

```
curl -X POST <https://api.dev.credyt.ai/usage> \\
  -H "X-CREDYT-KEY: sk_test_123" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{
    "events": [
      {
        "id": "843772b7-9df4-4776-9f63-d3dce4efcaf4",
        "customer_id": "cust_473cr1y0ghbyc3m1yfbwvn3nxx",
        "event_type": "message_completed",
        "occurred_at": "2025-09-16T12:05:00Z",
        "data": {
          "model": "gpt-4-1",
          "input_tokens": 2353,
          "output_tokens": 34697
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

<Accordion title="Check the Wallet Balance">
  A wallet is created automatically on the first top-up - no extra calls required.

  Wallets can contain multiple sub-accounts, one per asset or currency type.

  ```bash
  curl https://api.dev.credyt.ai/customers/cust_473cr1y0ghbyc3m1yfbwvn3nxx/wallet \
    -H "X-CREDYT-KEY: sk_test_123"
  
  ```

  ➡️ Response (simplified):

  ```json
  {
    "accounts": [
      { "id": "default:usd", "available": 46.47 }
    ]
  }
  
  ```
