## Billing Core

**Real-time billing engine** - Meter and charge usage instantly, ensuring accurate, up-to-the-second billing for any AI workload.

**Advanced pricing configuration model** - Define complex pricing structures with TODO to match diverse monetisation strategies.

**Simulation Engine** - Test and validate product setups or pricing scenarios without affecting balances, giving you confidence before going live.

## Payments and Funding

**Wallet-native, multi-account architecture** - Flexible wallet design supports multiple sub-accounts in any unit (fiat currencies, credits, tokens, minutes) under a single customer.

**Built-in payments processing** - Use Credyt’s Stripe integration out of the box or connect your own PSP for full flexibility. Stripe Tax supported.

**Auto Top-up** - Keep customer balances funded automatically when thresholds are reached, preventing service interruptions and ensuring continuous usage. Credyt manages retries and failure notifications for you.

**Built-in Billing Portal** - A fully functional, hosted billing experience that requires almost no integration effort. Generate a session link, redirect the customer, and they can top up, track usage, review spend, and manage balances without you building any of that UI yourself.

**Free credits and gifts** - Credyt allows you to grant gifts or free credits to customers through the Adjustments API. This lets you reward users, run promotions, or compensate for issues with a simple API call that updates their wallet balance in real-time.

## Developer Experience

**Integration patterns built for scale** - The API follows simple, consistent patterns and supports event-driven workflows. This makes it straightforward to plug Credyt into existing architectures and handle billing at scale with minimal custom logic.

**Extensible metadata** - Attach contextual data to customers, payments, or events for easier integration with your internal systems and analytics.

**Idempotent API design** - Every request is safe to retry, preventing double charges or inconsistent state - a critical safeguard for billing systems.

## Roadmap / Coming Soon

**Cost analytics** – Managing cost is critical for the commercial success of AI products. Credyt will let you track and allocate costs from day one.

- Add costs directly to usage events, and Credyt will group them by product, task, or service - showing where margins are thin and where monetisation opportunities exist.
- For costs that aren’t available in real time (e.g. monthly infrastructure bills), you’ll be able to send them separately, and Credyt will put them in context alongside your revenues and usage costs.
- This combined view of revenues, costs, and margins will help you continuously refine pricing and protect profitability.

**Time-to-value tracking**

Time-to-value measures the duration from the initial customer request to the completion of the task. It is a foundation for **outcome-based pricing**, which is emerging as the next frontier in monetisation. By linking time-to-value with cost and price, Credyt will help you identify new revenue opportunities, optimise system performance, and view value, cost, and margin together in one context.
